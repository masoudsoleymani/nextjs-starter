# Next.js starter

[Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview) allows you to easily build [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) static apps.

## Running locally

To run locally, open the development server with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Next, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the app by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
